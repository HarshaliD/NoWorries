      " {\n",
      "  \"response\": \"While it's difficult to immediately stop a panic attack once it begins, there are techniques to help you feel safer and manage the experience. Some suggestions include: \\n\\n*   **Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and smoking:** These substances can worsen panic attacks.\\n*   **Make lifestyle changes:** Incorporate regular exercise to manage stress, relieve tension, and boost your mood. Eating regular, healthy meals and avoiding processed foods and drinks can also help stabilize blood sugar levels.\\n*   **Challenge your thoughts:** Avoid scanning your body for evidence of something being wrong. Instead, focus on something to make yourself feel safe, such as sitting down if you feel faint or lying down if you think you're having a heart attack.\\n\\nIf panic attacks are a recurring issue, consider exploring resources like the Centre for Clinical Interventions (CCI) workbooks for additional support: https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/\"\n",

      " It sounds like you're looking for ways to manage panic attacks, and grounding techniques can be really helpful. It's great that you're being proactive about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few ideas based on the information you shared, keeping in mind that everyone is different, and it might take some experimenting to find what works best for you:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Focus on your senses:** The goal is to bring you back to the present moment. You can try the 5-4-3-2-1 method. Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Safe actions:** Is there something you can do to make yourself feel safer in the moment? The information mentions that some people try gulping air if they feel like they are suffocating, sitting down if they feel faint, or lying down if they think they are having a heart attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to remember that panic attacks can feel very intense, and it's okay to seek help. The information mentions that many people go to the emergency room during their first panic attack, thinking something dangerous is happening. If you ever feel like you need immediate medical attention, please don't hesitate to seek it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the Centre for Clinical Interventions (CCI) website ([https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/)) offers workbooks that might be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to these techniques, the information also suggests some lifestyle changes that can help reduce the frequency and intensity of panic attacks:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Avoid stimulants:** Try to limit or avoid caffeine, alcohol, and cigarettes.\n",
      "*   **Exercise regularly:** Physical activity can help manage stress and improve your mood.\n",
      "*   **Eat a healthy diet:** Regular meals and avoiding\n"
